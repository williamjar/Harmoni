"Harmoni" is a web application for creating and organizing events. You can keep track of events, and performers, crew and documents that are tied to that event. 
Harmoni is designed with both accessibility and universal design in mind. The web design is focused on simplicity at the same time as having the features you wish for as an event organizer. The website is currently only available in Norwegian.

<h2>Quick start installation guide</h2>


To run our system, run these commands in a command window with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "git download page") installed. You also need [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "npm and node"). We have used node 13 for our project, and recommend you use the same. 

```

git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/williaj/harmoni-team-7.git

cd harmoni-team-7/application/server
 
npm install
```

This will take some time.
```
npm start
```
This will start the server running on port 8080 on localhost of your machine.
```
cd ../client

npm install

npm start
```

Your development server will now start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "Your local machine").

And that's it! If you have any questions or bugs, please feel free to contact us.
